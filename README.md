#### Description: Hello CS50 my name is Guilherme and my project is a simple curriculum generator where there is a user registration system, login and logout. The main page is where you enter your information and download a pdf with a ready-made curriculum. the project backend was made with python and flask, the front end was made using bootstrap. The register page has a database connection and to connect I used the SQLAlchemy library. To create the pdf of the curriculum I used the pdfkit library where I can generate pdf from html and css.
