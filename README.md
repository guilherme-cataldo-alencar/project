#### Description: Hello CS50 my name is Guilherme and my project is a simple curriculum generator where there is a user registration system, login and logout. The main page is where you enter your information and download a pdf with a ready-made resume. the project backend was made with python and flask, the front end was made using bootstrap. The registration page has a connection to the database and to connect I used the SQLAlchemy library where after trying to use sqlite3 several times without success, I ended up finding on the internet a way to connect the flask and a database. As for generating the curriculum, it was a very difficult part because I tested several pdf generation libraries but they were all very difficult, I even thought about changing projects but luckily I found the pdfkit library where in the library it said that I could create pdfs using html and css that It impressed me because I thought it wasn't possible. Then came the other challenge to make a code to generate an html to become a pdf, and after days of work I finally managed to use a string where I passed this string to the pdfkit and become a pdf. This project was really cool to do because I learned to read the documentation of the libraries, because a lot of things were hard to find in places other than the library's doc. this is cs50; printf("Thank you for content");return 0;
